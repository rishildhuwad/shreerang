                Colour certainly increases the beauty, realism and decorative value.
                It quickly attracts the attention of the observer especially when fluorescent colors
                are used. Colour that we perceive is necessarily the stimulation of our visual sensory
                organs by the selectively reflected portion of day-light received from an object.
                The incident light is partially reflected and partially absorbed by normal conventional
                pigments, the absorbed portion being dissipated as heat. But fluorescent pigments have
                peculiar property of reflecting some portion of light and transforming the absorbed
                portion of light and U.V. Radiation in to emitted visible light of the same colour,
                thus adding extra reflected light to the colour, which appears extra ordinarily bright,
                glowing and fluorescent. This phenomenon is called daylight fluorescence and the pigments
                are called as day-light fluorescent pigments. Shreeranglow fluorescent pigments are
                day-light fluorescent pigments and are recommended for various applications.
